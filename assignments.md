### Policies and Submission Instructions
* Assignments are to be handed in individually; 
* You are required to typeset your solutions, preferrably using \\( \LaTeX \\). You can either use a local \\( \LaTeX \\) installation on you machine, or the web-based [ShareLaTeX](https://www.sharelatex.com). Another (maybe easier) option for typesetting is [Madoko](https://www.madoko.net/), which is a _markdown_ processor with immediate \\( \LaTeX \\) support (it produces beautiful pdf and html pages);
* You will be submitting your typeset solutions to gradescope;
* You may discuss solutions with your colleagues, but the final write-up should be your own.
