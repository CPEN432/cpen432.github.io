### Hardware

We will provide you the following hardware for the project.

1. TTL-to-USB Serial Debug Console Cable
2. Rapberry Pi B2 Board + power adapter + MicroSD Card (for kernel flashing)
3. Two plastic boxes to conveniently store the hardware

### Groups

Form groups of five. You may use Piazza to find group members. Provide [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/) usernames of all group members to both instructors over email. Use subject line “[CPEN 432] Project Group Registration”. Let us know if you are unable to form a group by 19 January. After you have formed a group, one of the group members must collect the hardware. Schedule a five-minute meeting with both instructors over email for collecting the hardware. Use subject line “[CPEN 432] Hardware Collection”.

### Submission Instructions

For each project assignment, we will create a GitLab repository for each group with a detailed README for the project. You must commit all your solutions to the repository before the deadline. We may schedule a demo during the tutorial hours to evaluate the programming assignments.

### Late Project Submissions

Each group is allocated an automatic extension of 4 calendar days. Groups can use the extension on any project component in increments of 1 day. E.g., you can hand in one project assignment 4 days late, or one assignment 2 days late and two assignments 1 day late, or 4 project assignments 1 day late. This extension is to be used for incidental occurrences, so **please do not ask us for any more extensions due to any incidental circumstances.**
